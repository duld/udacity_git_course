Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
   work local?
   
   Response:
    # I can imagine that when you are looking to actively share your code with
      other individuals a remote repository would be very useful. Any form of 
      collaboration would benefit with a remote repo. Also it is another form
      of backup, a versioned backup as well. 
      
      Although keeping anything that might need to remain private on your 
      public facing repo would be a bad. A very bad.
