Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Response:
 # When you initialize a git repository a hidden directory and a series of
   sub-directories and files are created. To initialize a repository you need 
   to use the 'git init' command while in the top directory directory desired 
   for use as a repo.

Google's Answer: 
 # The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to 
   convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize 
   a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside 
   of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll 
   run in a new project.
