Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Response:
	 # When you initialize a git repository a hidden directory and a series of
	   sub-directories and files are created. To initialize a repository you 
	   need to use the 'git init' command while in the top directory directory 
	   desired for use as a repo.

	Google's Answer: 
	 # The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to 
	   convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or 
	   initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not 
	   available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the 
	   first command you'll run in a new project.

	Thoughts:
	 # We have to use git init to setup a git repository so that we can track 
	   our changes to any files. We are using git as our version control so it 
	   would make sense that use git init to setup our directory to be a git 
	   repo.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
   repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Response:
	 # The staging area is different from the working directory in that it is 
	   explicity designating which file(s) are going to have their changes 
	   saved during the next commit.

	   The staging area is different from the repo because a repo represents 
	   the current state resulting from all previous commits. The staging are 
	   is essential the space or the files specified that will be updating the 
	   repo's state during the next commit.

	Google's Answer:
	 # Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit 
	   in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit. As long as 
	   a changeset is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you 
	   like (replace staged files with other versions of staged files, remove 
	   changes from staging, etc

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
   logical change?

   Response:
    # You can ensure that you have one logical change per commit by using the 
      'git diff' command. Using 'git diff' will list all additions and 
      deletions between the staging area and the working directory or the 
      staging area and any specified commit in the commit history.

   Google's Answer:
    # Not exactly answering the question but the consensus on Stack overflow 
      and the general internet is that you should commit often. And each time 
      you check in it should be for one block of code that is finished/stable/
      compiles. Every check in should at the very least be stable and not 
      break during the compilation or parsing step. This does not mean the code has to be 100% "correct".

      # General advice from StackOverflow Anders Sandvig
      "If you are doing many changes to a project at the same time, split them 
      up into logical parts and commit them in multiple sessions. This makes 
      it much easier to track the history of individual changes, which will 
      save you a lot of time when trying to find and fix bugs later on. For 
      example, if you are implementing feature A, B and C and fixing bug 1, 2 
      and 3, that should result in a total of at least six commits, one for 
      each feature and one for each bug. If you are working on a big feature 
      or doing extensive refactoring, consider splitting your work up into 
      even smaller parts, and make a commit after each part is completed. 
      Also, when implementing independent changes to multiple logical modules, 
      commit changes to each module separately, even if they are part of a 
      bigger change.

      Ideally, you should never leave your office with uncommitted changes on 
      your hard drive. If you are working on projects where changes will 
      affect other people, consider using a branch to implement your changes 
      and merge them back into the trunk when you are done. When committing 
      changes to libraries or projects that other projects—and thus, other 
      people—depend on, make sure you don’t break their builds by committing 
      code that won’t compile. However, having code that doesn’t compile is 
      not an excuse to avoid committing. Use branches instead."
