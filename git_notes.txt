	the Type: 
	  feat: a new feature
	  fix: a bug fix
	  docs: changes to documentation
	  style: formatting, missing semi colons, etc, no code change
	  refactor: refactoring production code
	  test: adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
	  chore: updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production 
	         code change.

	The Subject: 
	  Subjects should be no greater than 50 characters, should begin with a 
	  capital letter and do not end with a period.

	  Use an imperative tone to describe what a commit does, rather than what 
	  it did. For example, use change; not changed or changes.

	The Body:
	  Not all commits are complex enough to warrent a body, therefore it is 
	  optional and only used when a commit requires a bit of explanation and 
	  context. Use the body to explain the WHAT and WHY of a commit, not the 
	  how. Wrap text to 72 characters per line.

	The Footer:
	  The footer is optional and is only used to to reference tracker IDs.
